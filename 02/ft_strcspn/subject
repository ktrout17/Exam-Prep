Reproduce exactly the behavior of the function strcspn
(man strcspn).

The function should be prototyped as follows:

size_t	ft_strcspn(const char *s, const char *reject);




The strcspn() function spans the initial part of the null-terminated string s 
as long as the characters from s do not occur in the null-terminated string reject 
(it spans the complement of reject).  In other words, it computes the string array 
index of the first character of s which is also in reject, else the index of the 
first null character.
